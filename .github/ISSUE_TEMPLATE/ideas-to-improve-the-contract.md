I am not the best in the world in advocacy, liberalism, programming, rights, morals, etc. But if I trust my good judgment and I believe that there are people who are very good at what they do and who have good intentions, if you are one of them, any suggestion will be taken into account, it will be appreciated and the respective credits will be provided if it is finally implemented.
